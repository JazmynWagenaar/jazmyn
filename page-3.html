	"Now we're out of time
I said it's my fault
It's my fault
Can't make good decisions
It won't stop
I can't stop
Give me some time, I just need a little time
Give me some time, I just need a little time
Give me some time, I just need a little time
Give me some time, I just need a little time
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
It's only the end
It's only the end...hey.
We don't get the news
He says why not?
Why not?

Forget what you heard
'Cause it won't stop
it won't stop
Give 'em some time, They just need a little time
Give 'em some time, They just need a little time
Give 'em some time, They just need a little time
Give 'em some time, They just need a little time
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
It's only the end
It's only the end as you know it...
"You're not supposed to say that
you taught me too much"
Is this how it ends?
Is this how it ends?""
