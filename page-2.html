	"One shot is never enough
I just wait for us to go in circles
A lifetime of giving my all for you
(Hostile, give me a break)
(Don't say it's in the bottle of air)
At first he would tell me I'm his friend
Actually no thanks, I'm okay
And then he would send weird looks my way
I want new friends, but they don't want me
They're making plans while I watch TV
Thought it was you, but maybe it's me
I want new friends, but they don't want me
And the 80s song yeah, how did it go?
When they said, "This is the beginning of the best years"
Even though
False, break
One shot is never enough
I just wait for this to go into circles
And the distance from my room, is anything so necessary?
I was thinking about that thing that you said last night
So boring
And the 80s bands, oh where did they go?
Can we switch into the chorus right now?
I want new friends, but they don't want me
They have some fun, but then they just leave
Is it just them, or maybe all me?
Why my new friends don't seem to want me
Hurts my case but that's okay
It hurts my case but that's okay
We're dancing on a moonbeam
On and on and on and on and on
The deeper I get, the less that I know
That's the way that it goes
The less that I know, the deeper I go
Juliet, I adore
The deeper I get, the less that I know
Diminishing returns
Oh that's how it goes
All I wanna say
Oh, another song
Oh, another day
Oh, another song
Oh, another day
Oh, another song
Oh, another break"
